When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1)Keeping files in sync between multiple machines; though it feels like a long-winded way of doing it esp manually 
2)sharing codebase with others
3)build a project portfolio

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Well for my own use, I do not agree with the statement; so blank.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone of a GitHub repo to oneâ€™s own repo list. Clone is a local to local copy or GitHub to local copy of a repo. Branch splits local existing repo for new code, whilst keeping the project the same.
