When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

3)build a project portfolio

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Well for my own use, I do not agree with the statement; so blank.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone of a GitHub repo to one’s own repo list. Clone is a local to local copy or GitHub to local copy of a repo. Branch splits local existing repo for new code, whilst keeping the project the same.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
